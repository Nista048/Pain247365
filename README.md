# Pain247365
Pain 24/7 365 days a year yet family, friends and if they are still able to work --co-workers continually shout out, "But you look so good!" The end project is a conference:art gallery:place of healing and more. It is a multi-faceted project w/ telempathy, VR, photography, art installation, music album, jewelry specially designed for people with intractable pain, grief counselors, psychologists and doctors to talk about the systemic effects of IP in your body and the very real chance of a heart attack if pain is not treated correctly, groups for the PTSD from doctors and hospitals (friends and family) and the last combining effort which will bring people who not only do not have chronic or intractable pain but they do believe in its severity, consider that if people look all right then they are all right but have come to this conference and we will change minds and start to change the world a tiny bit, just a tad to get the ball rolling as I am sure so many others are doing as well.
